# gift-wrap
_Gift wraps your website._

Quick and dirty, you probably don't want to use this, unless it's for something intended to be quick and dirty ;)

### [Demo](http://mesoptier.github.io/gift-wrap/test/)

### Usage
Include `gift-wrap.min.css` and `gift-wrap.min.js` in your webpage, then call `new GiftWrap("Happy birthday!")` to display the gift wrap.
